# Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Delete Employee - "Employee ID is required" Error
**Problem:** When trying to delete an employee, the backend was not correctly parsing the employee ID from the URL path.

**Root Cause:** 
- The path parsing logic was looking for the ID at index `[1]` instead of `[0]` after filtering the path
- URLs like `/index.php/5` were being parsed incorrectly

**Solution:**
- Updated `backend/index.php` to properly filter and re-index the path array
- Changed from `$pathParts[1]` to `$pathParts[0]` after filtering empty elements
- Added `.htaccess` file for proper URL rewriting

### 2. Update Employee - Fields Showing "undefined"
**Problem:** When opening the edit modal, all employee fields displayed "undefined" instead of actual values.

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend was calling `/index.php/{id}` but the backend routing wasn't handling this correctly
- The GET request for individual employees was failing silently

**Solution:**
- Simplified API endpoints to use clean URLs without `/index.php`
- Updated all frontend API calls:
  - `GET /{id}` instead of `/index.php/{id}`
  - `PUT /{id}` instead of `/index.php/{id}`
  - `DELETE /{id}` instead of `/index.php/{id}`
  - `POST /` instead of `/index.php`
  - `GET /?page=1` instead of `/index.php?page=1`

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. **backend/index.php**
   - Improved path parsing logic
   - Added proper array filtering and re-indexing

2. **backend/.htaccess** (NEW)
   - Added URL rewriting rules
   - Enables clean URLs without `/index.php`

### Frontend
3. **frontend/app.js**
   - Updated `loadEmployees()` function
   - Updated `openEditModal()` function
   - Updated `setupFormHandler()` function
   - Updated `openDeleteModal()` function
   - All API calls now use clean URLs

### Documentation
4. **README.md**
   - Updated API endpoint documentation
   - Reflects new clean URL format

## Testing

All CRUD operations have been tested and verified:
- ✅ **CREATE**: Adding new employees works correctly
- ✅ **READ**: Fetching employee list and individual employees works
- ✅ **UPDATE**: Editing employee details works with proper data loading
- ✅ **DELETE**: Deleting employees works with correct ID parsing

## API Endpoints (Updated)

| Method | Endpoint | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| GET | `/?page=1&limit=10` | ✅ Working |
| GET | `/{id}` | ✅ Working |
| POST | `/` | ✅ Working |
| PUT | `/{id}` | ✅ Working |
| DELETE | `/{id}` | ✅ Working |

## How to Verify

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Try editing an employee - fields should populate correctly
3. Try deleting an employee - should delete without "ID required" error
4. Try adding a new employee - should work normally
5. Try updating an employee - should save changes correctly
